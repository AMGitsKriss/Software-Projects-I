Background:
We have decided to build a social networking website where students can make groups and post 
their ideas and record bookmarks. The website will be able to suggest things to the users based on the tags on their 
previous posts and bookmarks.Although any one can use the website our main target users will most likely be students.
One of the reasons we are making this website is because most of the websites that are out there for students to
use have poor usability (bad user interface) and this can discourage students from using these types of websites 
which can help them with their studies and help them further their learning capacity by interacting with other 
students that are having the same problems as them or interacting with other students that have solutions to 
problems that they are having difficulties solving.
We will be using HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript and Ajax to code the website.

Suggestion:
Maybe have one or more cookies on the website (To remember specific information about a particular individual).
The website could also have an option to make posts public.
