# Software-Projects-I




What we want the software to do.
- How we want the software to perform.
- A set of specific, clear, unambiguous statements.

Requirements are based on a set of needs. (People and scenarios)
- What do the users need?
- What do the other people involved need?
- What do other interacting systems need?
- Often a compromise between competing needs.

Milestones?

Gather/analysis data on relevant needs
- Turn this into a set of draft requirements
- Iterate the requirements, until they are...
- Practical and feasible (we can do this)
- Specific, clear, unambiguous (we’ll know when
we’re done)!


Things to consider:

- Access to links, and adding of links with as few clicks as possible.
- Probably wouldn't replace a VLE as a source of reading material, but would rather be used by collaborating individuals.
- Aiming it at individuals and "anyone collaborating on something" is the same as "at students." The only difference is scale of implementation.
- Would a survey be useful here?
- Would it be better to investigate how people interact with websites?
- Would it be better to verbally ask people how they would share links between a group, or save their bookmarks between devices? Why do they do it that way?

More things to consider:

- How do we want the software to perform? User experience?
- User Flow
- What does the user need? (This list is like a set of requirements)
- What other platforms can perform this task? (Reddit, Facebook, etc)
- What are their pitfalls? (E.g Reddit voting system is a hindrance to collaboration. Can't have private subreddits)

Other things to consider:

- What have people already done like this?
- What do we want to achieve?
- Investigate a 'situation'
- Who would use i?t
- Is a questionaire/survey useful?
- How will we gather data? (usability & usefulness)
