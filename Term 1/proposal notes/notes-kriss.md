## Kriss's Notes

**Abstract/Summary**
To create an online application whose core functionality is the recording of bookmarks (like a reading list). Will build on this with the implementation of groups and sharing links into/on them, along with tags for each link and user postable comments to allow for *some* discussion. This simpler focus would be to allow individuals to save their own bookmarks, and share pages with others. 

The next step would be to use information gathered from the links to find and suggest pages that users and groups might be interested in, based on their existing saved material. This recommender engine could them perhaps be adapted into a kind of basic search engine that allows people to find similar things with a url, without them searching for keywords or "similar images". This would be done by collecting tags from each bookmark added, such as keywords, suspected topic, site name, date, page author, etc, then processing the information to find potentially similar entries.

To be built in PHP and mySQL.

Things to consider: 
- Access to links, and adding of links with as few clicks as possible. 
- Probably wouldn't replace a VLE as a source of reading material, but would rather be used by collaborating individuals.
- Aiming it at individuals and "anyone collaborating on something" is the same as "at students." The only difference is scale of implementation. 
- Would a survey be useful here?
- Would it be better to investigate how people interact with websites?
- Would it be better to verbally ask people how they would share links between a group, or save their bookmarks between devices? Why do they do it that way?

More things to consider: 
- How do we want the software to perform? User experience?
- User Flow
- What does the user need? (This list is like a set of requirements)
- What other platforms can perform this task? (Reddit, Facebook, etc)
- What are their pitfalls? (E.g Reddit voting system is a hindrance to collaboration. Can't have private subreddits)
