Background:
We have decided to build a social networking website where students can make groups and post 
their ideas and record bookmarks. The website will be able to suggest things to the users based on the tags on their 
previous posts and bookmarks.Although any one can use the website our main target users will most likely be students.
One of the reasons we are making this website is because most of the websites that are out there for students to
use have poor usability (bad user interface) and this can discourage students from using these types of websites 
which can help them with their studies and help them further their learning capacity by interacting with other 
students that are having the same problems as them or interacting with other students that have solutions to 
problems that they are having difficulties solving.
We will be using HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript and Ajax to code the website.

We will be using user centered design meaning we will be looking at the users behaviour and needs, so that our website 
can be more suited (appealing) to the users. we will be using questionnaires to collect information about what the users
would like our website to have or not have.

Suggestion:
Maybe have one or more cookies on the website (To remember specific information about a particular individual).
The website could also have an option to make posts public.

Questions to answer:
Will the users need a lot of computer experience to navigate around and use the website?

Persona:
Bob Richards
The users of the website will be people like Bob Richards. Bob is studying journalism at university and is in his first year. Bob has always had an interest in journalism, he always keeps up with current affairs with politics (both nationally and world). He mostly use sources like the BBC, Aljazeera, Russian TV and Press TV.
He is a serious surfer of the World Wide Web and is always on the lookout for people that have a real interest in finding out the truth behind stories that are shown on the news, so he can work with them and use them to build his own network of informants for his future career as a journalist. Bob’s aim (goal) for entering university is to finish his degree with a first and enter into the world of journalism working for a legitimate newspaper. He thinks that the news will entirely be distributed online in the near future and newspapers will become completely obsolete and they will have to change their platform to be completely online. Bob has been using his spare time to learn some basic web coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that he will be ready to serve the news on any platform whether it be on paper or online.
Bob usually prefers to stay at home and use the cyber world to interact with people; most of his contacts with people he considers are on the same career path as him is online using websites like Facebook and twitter. Bob sees the internet as the most efficient way of sharing information with an audience and because it has become such a big part of the world we live in now, people who usually would have no interaction with each other let alone know of each other’s existence have become connected through the internet so when it comes to news Bob considers himself as part of the generation with no borders that will make big changes to the world community and how people are treated across the world. A serious advocator of free press in countries he considers are under dictatorship and he has a real disdain towards any form of state controlled media.   
Context scenario:
Bob gets up at 7:00am makes himself breakfast then checks his emails on his phone and skims through trending topics on tweeter and news sites then packs his laptop in his bag and leaves his house at 8:15. He takes the train to his university, once the lecture starts the lecturer appoints everyone to a group then explains to them their assignment. He exchanges contact numbers with the people in his group and they arrange to meet up every Tuesday to exchange any new ideas or new things they might have discovered.
