##What does it need to meet? (aims/objectives)

To create an online application whose core functionality is the recording of bookmarks (like a reading list). Will build on this with the implementation of groups and sharing links into/on them, along with tags for each link and user postable comments to allow for some discussion. This simpler focus would be to allow individuals to save their own bookmarks, and share pages with others. 

The website should be able to suggest things to the users based on the tags on their previous posts and bookmarks. Although any one can use the website our main target users will most likely be students. One of the reasons we are making this website is because most of the websites that are out there for students to use have poor usability (bad user interface) and this can discourage students from using these types of websites which can help them with their studies and help them further their learning capacity by interacting with other students that are having the same problems as them or interacting with other students that have solutions to problems that they are having difficulties solving.

##Data Gathering and Requirements

> Explain the computer science problems presented by your project, satisfying the programme learning outcome “Apply computational thinking to the design and implementation of moderately complex computing systems”.


KAM DID A SURVAY RIGHT? WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM WHAT?

PERSONA GOES IN HERE... PROBABLY... MAYBE... I GUESS....

##Ethical audit
> You should detail any issues of privacy, data protection or intellectual property rights that may arise, and how you will manage them. You should confirm that you will not be working with minors or vulnerable adults.

The only user information that will be saved by the application is a username, password and email address. Passwords will be hashed for security.Items users post will be set to private unless explicitly shared by the user. 

##Design
> Design concepts, alternatives considered, chosen design.

##Prototyping
> Describe the prototyping you did, and what you learned from this.

We drew wireframes on a whiteboard and discussed together what should go where and why. We've also started considering how to structure the database tables.

##Evaluation Plan
> How you intend to test and evaluate your software during and after development. It may be useful to specify individual test cases.

##Project management
> How you will manage the development process: roles, Gantt charts, milestones,
development methodology etc.

##Conclusion
> Summarise your proposal, including the key points from the previous sections.

##Bibliography
> A list of published sources referenced in the proposal.

##Appendices
> The appendix or appendices should contain your group meeting minutes and any
additional raw material that is referred to in the text (e.g. data from requirements gathering, paper prototypes etc.)
