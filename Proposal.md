##What does it need to meet? (aims/objectives)

To create an online application whose core functionality is the recording of bookmarks (like a reading list). Will build on this with the implementation of groups and sharing links into/on them, along with tags for each link and user postable comments to allow for some discussion. This simpler focus would be to allow individuals to save their own bookmarks, and share pages with others. 

##Who does it need to meet?

The website will be able to suggest things to the users based on the tags on their previous posts and bookmarks. Although any one can use the website our main target users will most likely be students. One of the reasons we are making this website is because most of the websites that are out there for students to use have poor usability (bad user interface) and this can discourage students from using these types of websites which can help them with their studies and help them further their learning capacity by interacting with other students that are having the same problems as them or interacting with other students that have solutions to problems that they are having difficulties solving.
