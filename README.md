# Software-Projects-I

What we want the software to do.!
• How we want the software to perform.!
• A set of specific, clear, unambiguous statements.!
• For a website...!
• “Every page should download in less than 5 seconds.”!
• “It should appeal to teenage girls.”

Requirements are based on a set of needs.
• What do the users need?!
• What do the other people involved need?!
• What do other interacting systems need?!
• Often a compromise between competing needs.

Gather/analysis data on relevant needs!
• Turn this into a set of draft requirements!
• Iterate the requirements, until they are...!
• Practical and feasible (we can do this)
• Specific, clear, unambiguous (we’ll know when
we’re done)!
• And stable (not going to change)
